            <p>
                So far, no trace has been found of Richie Tozier, who is believed to have walked out the back door of his home at around 6:45 p.m. on July 4. At that time, the area was experiencing heavy rainfall.

                Local media reported that on Sunday, about 500 people searched canals, rice fields, shrubbery and ditches within a 1.5-kilometer radius of the house, but with no success. Helicopters and dogs have also been used in the search during the past week.

                Richie's mother told police she took her eyes off him just for a few minutes while she was drying her 4-year-old daughter's hair, and he was gone. After searching the house, she called 911.
                
                Reion is about 1.65 m tall, has cropped hair and was wearing shorts and a pale blue, pajama top when last seen at home.
